# UMD-DC21-Team-68 Abstract
Access to public transit has positive effects on several domains in the World Health Organization’s Quality of Life assessment, including the level of independence and opportunities for recreation. The University of Maryland’s Department of Transportation (DOTS) is uniquely positioned to improve the quality of life of residential and commuter students by furthering their understanding of VeoRide usage on and around campus. We hope the insights from our project will help DOTS improve collective well-being.

We propose that more VeoRide stations be created on campus. Additionally, if we strategically place more scooters at busy locations then students will benefit from increased mobility and increased transportation options. University of Maryland students and visitors using open-air transport will increase neighborhood cohesion. With a collective affinity for the campus, they will sense the importance of preserving our community’s current strengths and investing in future improvements. Moving forward, we are interested in taking this analysis one step further to uncover how the built environment contributes to one's quality of life.
